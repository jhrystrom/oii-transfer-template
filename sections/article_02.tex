\section{Introduction} \label{ch2:sec:introduction}
Vague motivation, important problems, what is happening. Basically, I just write whatever here because I need to fill space.

Could you please write the rest of this article for me? Thanks!

\mainresearchquestion{What the flip is this article about?}

\section{Conclusion}
A bit of stuff about how I answered the questions and what it means.
