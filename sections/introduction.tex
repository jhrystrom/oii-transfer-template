Why is the evil in the world? Cancer, climate change, inequality, injustice, suffering. These are some of the biggest challenges facing humanity today, and they demand urgent attention and action.

This thesis solves all of the above problems using AI. Magic AI that cures cancer, reverses climate change, and brings about world peace.


\section{Contributions of this DPhil Thesis}

The overarching aim of this thesis is as follows:


\coreaim{To solve all the important problems in the world using AI.}

To accomplish this aim, I propose an integrated thesis with three empirical chapters:

\paragraph{Article I: Foundational Stuff}
The first article does the ground work.


\paragraph{Article II: Improvise, Adapt, Overcome}
The second article focuses on adapting existing AI systems to solve important problems in the world.
Specifically, I solve climate change by developing AI and connecting it to a weather balloon through the blockchain \citep{jevonsCoalQuestionInquiry1866}. 



\paragraph{Article III: Curing Cancer and World Peace}
The third article focuses on curing cancer and bringing about world peace using AI.



Taken together, these articles will demonstrate the transformative potential of AI to address some of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today.
