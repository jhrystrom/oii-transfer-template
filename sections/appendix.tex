\chapter{Selected Relevant Publications}
During the first year of my DPhil, I have co-authored papers that contribute to my thesis (`Core Research Papers' below). I have also contributed to other papers, that are focused on random stuff. All together these have been instrumental in providing me with the necessary experience and perspective to succeed in the proposed articles and ensure that I make a meaningful contribution to the field of whatever.
